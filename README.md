# Disclaimer
Most of the code has been created by configuring a project for the Nucleo-L476RG Development board in STM32CubeIDE's GUI. This includes drivers for SPI and FreeRTOS initialization.

The content worth looking at that has been written by me is located within files `Core/src/freertos.c`, `Core/src/lights_functions.c`, and `Core/src/lights_test.c`.
